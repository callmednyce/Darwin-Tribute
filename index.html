        <h3>After birth, Darwin's powers of self-protection and continuous circumstantial evolution made his mother hate
            him.
            The Afro-Hispanic[1] boy was found by scientists who experimented on him, bringing him to the attention of
            the public.
            He was found by Moira MacTaggert and recruited as one of her "fosters".
            He was in the first team, along with Kid Vulcan, Petra, and Sway to attempt to rescue the X-Men from Krakoa.
